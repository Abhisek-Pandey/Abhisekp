                    Attending the <b>Make in Odisha Conclave 2022</b> from November 30th to December 4th in Bhubaneswar
                    was a transformative experience, blending insights into Odisha's industrial future with personal
                    discoveries and professional growth. The event, organized by the Government of Odisha, aimed to
                    propel the state into a new era of industrial and technological advancement.

                <h4 class="h4">A Grand Beginning</h4>
                <p>
                    The conclave kicked off with a powerful inaugural session led by Chief Minister <b>Naveen
                    Patnaik</b>. The Chief Minister highlighted Odisha's strategic focus on new-age technologies and
                    skilling initiatives, announcing an impressive budgetary provision of Rs. 100 crores for training
                    youth in fields like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and data sciences. This commitment
                    set the tone for the event, underscoring the state's dedication to harnessing technology for future
                    growth.
                </p>
                <h4 class="h4">Investment Milestones</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the standout achievements of the conclave was the announcement of investment proposals worth
                    Rs. 10.5 lakh crore (over $130 billion). These investments, expected to create over one million
                    jobs,
                    highlighted Odisha's potential as a major industrial hub. The emphasis was not just on large-scale
                    projects but also on nurturing startups across sectors such as agriculture, food processing,
                    healthcare, and manufacturing.
                </p>
                <h4 class="h4">Immersive Experiences</h4>
                <p>
                    For me and my other batch mates, attending the conclave was an eye-opening experience.
                    Accompanied by
                    a faculty member, we explored the extensive arrangements made for industry professionals and
                    participants. The diversity of exhibits was astonishing, showcasing everything from advanced jet
                    engines to underwater submarines. These demonstrations provided us with a firsthand look at the
                    cutting-edge technologies driving various industries.
                </p>
                <h4 class="h4">Engaging Discussions</h4>
                <p>
                    We attended several insightful sessions throughout the event. The first session, focused on
                    building a coherent skill ecosystem in India, emphasized the importance of aligning skill training
                    initiatives with market demands. Moderated by <b>Ms. Usha Padhee</b>, Principal Secretary of the
                    Skill
                    Development & Technical Education Department, the discussion featured a distinguished panel,
                    including representatives from the World Bank, UN Women India, and the Tamil Nadu Skill Development
                    Corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another impactful session on industry-led skilling addressed the disruptions caused by Industry 4.0
                    technologies such as AI and robotics. This session offered intriguing insights into the gig economy,
                    demographic shifts, and the evolving landscape of work in India. Hearing from experts like <b>Ms.
                    Trishaljit Sethi</b>, Director General (Training) of the Directorate General of Training, and
                    <b>Mr. Manoj Agrawal</b> from Maruti Suzuki, provided a deeper understanding of the challenges and
                    opportunities ahead.
                </p>
                <h4 class="h4">Personal Reflections and Learning</h4>
                <p>
                    A memorable part of our participation was the opportunity to present our innovative ideas during a
                    dedicated tour. Engaging with industry experts and receiving feedback on our concepts was
                    invaluable. It
                    was inspiring to see how our ideas were received and to learn from the experiences of others.

                    The exhibition also featured 130+ stalls showcasing the skilling prowess of various institutions and
                    industries. We interacted with representatives from ITI, Polytechnic, engineering colleges, and
                    technical universities, gaining insights into the diverse skilling initiatives underway across
                    Odisha.
                </p>
                <h4 class="h4">Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    The <b>Make in Odisha Conclave 2022</b> was not just an event but a catalyst for future growth and
                    innovation.
                    The massive investment commitments, focus on technology, and nurturing of startups all point to a
                    bright
                    future for Odisha. For us, it was a journey of learning and inspiration, providing a unique blend of
                    professional insights and personal growth.

                    Odisha's commitment to becoming a hub of industrial and technological excellence was evident
                    throughout
                    the conclave. For businesses and entrepreneurs looking to expand in India, Odisha presents a
                    compelling
                    opportunity with its investment-friendly policies and burgeoning infrastructure. Attending future
                    Make
                    in Odisha Conclaves will undoubtedly offer valuable opportunities for growth and collaboration.
